Project Title: Digital Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The Digital Clock project is a beginner-friendly web development exercise that involves creating a simple but functional digital clock. This project 
serves as an excellent introduction to web technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.


Technologies Used:

->HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the web page. It defines the layout and elements that make up the digital clock interface.

->CSS: Employed to style the digital clock's appearance. CSS adds visual appeal to the clock by setting fonts, colors, padding, and borders.

->JavaScript: Adds dynamic functionality to the project. JavaScript retrieves the current time, formats it, and updates the clock display in real-time.


Project Components:

->HTML Structure:

The HTML structure consists of a div element with the class "clock." This div will contain the digital clock display.
Inside the clock div, there's another div with the class "time" and the id "time." This inner div will hold the formatted time.

->CSS Styling:

CSS styling is applied to the clock div to create a visually pleasing interface. This includes setting the font family, font size, background color,
padding, border radius, and a subtle box shadow.

->JavaScript Functionality:

JavaScript is responsible for fetching the current time using the Date object.
The current hours, minutes, and seconds are extracted from the Date object and formatted to ensure they are displayed in two-digit format (e.g., "05" instead of "5").
The formatted time string is then inserted into the inner div's content to update the clock display.


->Usage:

When a user opens the HTML file in a web browser, they will see a minimalistic digital clock on the screen. The clock will display the current time in hours,
minutes, and seconds, all in a consistent two-digit format. The seconds will tick in real-time, as the JavaScript function updates the clock's display every second.
